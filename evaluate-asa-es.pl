# key = "GA" or "CNS"
# "getarea.txt" is the ASA value for individual residue computed by

# or
# "cns-asa.txt" is computed by CNS 1.3 - a list of ASA for individual residue
#
# To estimated ASA for each each ES range (2-9 residues):
# Sum ( lamda * ASAj ), where j from 1 to n, n is the number of residues in the range
# where lamda is an efficiency factor, i.e. 95% (take 0.5% away of overlap area in neighboring residues)
